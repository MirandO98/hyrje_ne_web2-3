			    			<p>My favourite hobby is playing football. I play football when I am free. I started to play football when I was seven. I was interested in it at that time because it was exciting and it could make me healthy. At the first time, my football coach taught me how to play football. I felt excited at that time. Personally I play football for both training and fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the technique, and moving on the pitch builds the condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice feeling, what makes football a good game for minimizing the stress. Itâ€™s good to have an onfield idol, that you can watch to improve your skills. My idol is Ronaldo, because I love the way he dribbles and passes.</p>
